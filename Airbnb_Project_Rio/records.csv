If you turn on the tap, it automatically turns on the gas, but it is important to leave the window in the bathroom ALWAYS open for safety reasons, even when you leave the apartment. This is a rule of the gas company. 2 – There is an air conditioner in the bed room, it is very important that you turn off the air conditioner when you leave the apartment in order for it not to break. If the air conditioning breaks, it can take long to fix and you will ended up staying without cold temperature in the room. As soon as you turn it on, it will refrigerate the room very fast. Another tip is to leave the door of the bathroon always closed, so the bed room will be colder when the air conditioner is on.  3 – The fan in the ceiling is enough to refrigerate the living room.  4 – The window in the kitchen shall always be left open too because of the natural gas installation in the st",,,within a day,100%,f,2,-22.97433634,-43.1882973,Apartment,Entire home/apt,4,1,1,1,Real Bed,"{TV,""Cable TV"",Internet,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",Kitchen,Doorman,Elevator,""Buzzer/wireless intercom"",""Family/kid friendly"",Washer,Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",Microwave,""Coffee maker"",Refrigerator,""Dishes and silverware"",""Cooking basics"",Oven,Stove}",,$143.00 ,"$1,500.00 ",$250.00 ,3,$50.00 ,2,22,96,10,10,10,10,10,9,f,f,strict,2018,4

"ABOUT THE HOST Gabriel’s goal is to make sure that you have an awesome experience in Rio and can focus on the important stuff, like your vacation - not worry about accommodation!  He will normally be around most days and very happy to give you advice and suggestions for getting around Rio and places to visit. Occasionally he has given guests short tours of Rio, but this is not a standard part of the package because of time constraints. Born and raised at Leme neighborhood in Rio, the mystique of the Chapeu Mangueira’s Favela and the beauty of its people were always present in his life and imagination. As an adult he had the opportunity to work three years with children and families as a psychologist for a local organization called “Casa da Árvore”. As a result, he became completely involved with Chapéu Mangueira and decided to move from his comfortable apartment in Ipanema to live in the community. Always proud of this neighborhood, it is common to see him walking around with friends a","HOUSE RULES •Relax and make yourself comfortable.  •Do not smoke inside the house. If you use ciggies, cigars, or a pipe, please light up on the balcony.
