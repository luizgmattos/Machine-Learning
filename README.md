The purpose of this repository is to upload in different folders all the projects I have done in my free time in order to keep practice coding and improving my knowledge.

This repository will have multiple codes in machine learning being applied into end to end projects in various areas, from health, financial market, housing, credit card frauds, some code enhancement from previous College codes and other areas that I feel interested in about starting.

I found that practicing and uploading this codes into this repository will give me some sort of portfolio to display whenever doing some interview process or applying to some job.
